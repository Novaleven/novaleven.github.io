<ul>
<li>Personal background:  Was born in Massachusetts and moved to South Carolina when I was 11.  Lived there until I was about 22, and have been living in Charlotte since!  Raised by my mother and grandmother, and I have one close brother.  I also have a developmental disorder, but I don't let it stop me!
</li><li>Professional background:  Didn't get my first paid job until I was about 19.  Worked mostly retail since then, with one factory/warehouse job under my belt.  Currently working at a hotel.  Have done some volunteer work here and there but nothing consistent.  

</li><li>Academic background:  Graduated high school at Greer High School in Greer, South Carolina on May 2013.  Attended University of South Carolina - Upstate in Spartanburg for 2 and a half years.  Since moving to Charlotte I have attended Central Piedmont Community College.  My first major was Education and received the Teaching Fellows scholarship to attend school.  Upon moving to Charlotte I changed my major to Medical Assisting.  Once again, I have changed my major to my current IT major.

</li><li>Background in the subject matter of this course: I've taken two IT classes prior to this class (One was for HTML, databases, and Java.  Another was for networking).  Beyond that, I have had no hands on experience with coding or computer infrastructure.  I have a few friends who are IT majors.  My current IT major is Web Technologies (AAS).
</li><li>Primary computer platform: I have a Windows XP laptop, but I do not own a desktop computer.
</li><li>Reason for taking each course: ◦WEB 110-01: Internet/ Web Fundamentals - Taking this because it is a requirement of my major and focus.  Also, I would like to know more about HTML
</li><li>CSC 143-90: Object Oriented Programming - Also taking this because it is a major/focus requirement.
</li>
<li>Funny story or interesting item about yourself to remember you by: I work at the Hyatt Place Charlotte Downtown (it's actually only about 2 minutes away from campus), and I accidentally set off the fire alarm!  I was heating up some food I brought from home in the hotel oven and underestimated how hot it would get.  The fact that the hotel was at 98% occupancy only made it worse.  I actually printed off an apology letter and delivered it to every room in the hotel.    Heh.
<li>I'd also like to share: I love learning languages!  I'm good at Spanish and currently learning Korean, Japanese, Arabic, and Russian.</li>
